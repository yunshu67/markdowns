## HTML Elements

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

```html
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
```

The HTML **element** is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
```

```html
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
```

**Note:** Some HTML elements have no content (like the `<br>`element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!





## Nested HTML Elements

- HTML elements can be nested (<u>this means that elements can contain other elements</u>).

- All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

- The following example contains four HTML elements (`<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>` and `<p>`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- All the elements:
  - `<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`





## Empty HTML Elements

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The `<br>` tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

```html
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
```

<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>



## HTML is Not Case Sensitive

HTML tags are not case sensitive: `<P>` means the same as `<p>`.
