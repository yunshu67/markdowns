# Possible Improvements for the Paper

- [ ] adding figures 									

     - AutoML pipeline
       
     - different algorithms for CASH
  
- [ ] performance analysis for each algorithm 

- [x] referring the author: `<Author Name> et al. [Reference number]`

- [x] change the **footer** of the paper

- [ ] shorten the sentence

     >  “However, plenty of those don’t understand any machine learning algorithms, or only understand a bit basic, so as to permit such novices to quickly use artificial intelligence, for instance, to search out the best (machine learning) algorithm and suitable hyperparameters of this algorithm for a particular research problem, without having to know the (machine learning) algorithms themselves, a research direction called “Auto-machine learning” gradually attracted scientists’ eyeballs and has developed rapidly within the last ten years.”

- [ ] **Abstract**: Auto-WEKA and Auto-Sklearn are `tools` to implement Auto-ML not technologies.

- [ ] **Data Preprocessing**: data in real life can be structured/`unstructured` 

- [ ] **Feature Scaling**:

  - `vmin` and `vmax` need to be explained more properly

  - > Typically DP will scale the values into the range 0 to 1 by ~~calculate~~`calculating` the position of the value v between the maximum value vmax and minimum value vmin

- [ ] **Algorithm Selection**:  

     > Term A_lambda is used in this section before introducing it in the next section.

- [ ] **Auto-WEKA & Auto-Sklearn**: 

  >  While citing other papers, better was is to include the name of the first author and then cite it.

- [ ] **Conclusion**:
  - compare all methods
  - open problems
  - future work
